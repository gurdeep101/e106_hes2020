# After insulation, fall in consumption per degree is only 0.393 - 0.115 = 0.278.
# But the interpretation for the other two parameter estimates is more problematic
# since these represent predicted consumption when the temperature is zero. 
# This is on the lower edge of the observed range of temperatures and 
# would not represent a typical difference. 
# For other datasets, a continuous predictor value of zero might be far outside 
# the range and so these parameters would have little practical meaning.
# The solution is to center the temperature predictor by its mean and recompute t

# Center temperature by mean
# centering allows a more natural interpretation

The R command for Poisson 
Lets use Galapagos data to build a poisson regression model.

There are 30 Galapagos islands and 7 variables in the dataset. The relationship between the number of plant species and several geographic variables is of interest. The original dataset contained several missing values which have been filled for convenience.

```{r}
library(faraway)
library(MASS)
gala <- gala[,-2]

modp <- glm(Species ~ ., family=poisson, gala)
sumary(modp)
drop1(modp,test="Chi")
library(MASS)
modn <- glm(skips ~ .,negative.binomial(1),solder)
modn
drop1(modn,tes="Chi")
```

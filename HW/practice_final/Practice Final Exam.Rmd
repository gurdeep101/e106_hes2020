----------------------------------------------------


## Problem 1

Use the question1 data, fit the regression model on Y by using all the variables (X6 and X7 are categorical variables). Create development sample (70% of the data) and hold-out sample (30% of the data).  Perform statistical tests, use graphs or calculate the measures (e.g. VIF, Leverage Points, Cookâ€™s Distance) for questions below. Use the development sample for part a to d. Use the hold-out sample for part e.
  
a-) Is the model significant? Is there a Multicollinearity in the data? Are the errors Normally distributed with constant variance?

b-) Are there any influential or outlier observations?

c-) Can X5, X6, and X7 be dropped from the model? Perform the statistical test and state your final model.

d-) Develop an alternative model by using the Regression Tree and compare the performance against the regression model built in part a. 

f-) Score the model on hold-out sample, and recalibrate the model on the holdout sample. Compare the results against the final model derived part c.


## Problem 2

Use the question2 data set to answer this question. We are interested in predicting  (Y) the number of customers who complained about the service.
 
a-) Build a model to predict the number of complaints, perform the statistical tests that shows that model is significant

b-)   Find the predicted number complaints given the independent variables below and predict 95% confidence interval

X1=606 X2=41393	X3=3	X4=3.04	X5=6.32


## Problem 3 

Use question 3 data sets. Monthly data on amount of billings (Y) and on number of hours of staff time (X) for the 20 most recent months are recorded.

a-) Build a model to predict Y based on the independent variables and test if there is an autocorrelation persists in the data. If autocorrelation persists, remediate the autocorrelation. 

b-) X (Staff time) in month 21 is expected to be 3.625 thousand hours. Predict the amount of
billings in constant dollars for month 21, using a 99 percent prediction intervaL Interpret
your interval.


## Problem 4
 
Use question 4 data set, Create development sample (70% of the data) and hold-out sample (30% of the data) use set.seed(1023) before creating the samples.

 a-) Use the development sample , fit a linear regression model,  regression tree and  Neural Network Model, and calculate the SSE for each model, which method has the lowest SSE?
 
 b-) test the models performances on teh hold out sample, which model would you choose?


## Problem 5

Use Question 5 dataset, Y is a dichotomous response variable and X2, X3, and X4 are categorical variables. 

a-) Fit a regression model containing the predictor variables in first-order terms and interaction terms for all pairs of predictor variables on development sample. 

b-)Use the likelihood ratio test to determine whether all interaction terms can be dropped
from the regression model; State the alternatives, full and reduced models, decision rule, and conclusion. 

c-)For logistic regression model in part (a), use backward elimination to decide which predictor
variables can be dropped from the regression model.  Which variables are retained in the regression model?

d-) Conduct the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test for the appropriateness of the logistic regression function by forming five groups. State the alternatives, decision rule, and conclusion. 


e-) Make the prediction for the following two cases and calculate 95% confidence interval

X1=(33,6) X2=(1,1) X3=(1,1) X4=(0,0)
